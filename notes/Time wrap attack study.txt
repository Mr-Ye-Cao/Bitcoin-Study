Basic attack logic:
    Goal: Lower mining difficulty
    Approach:
        1. Publish block with marginally larger time stamp while following the 2 rules of time stamps to ensure block accepted
        2. Confuse majority miners to think the mining difficulty is harder than it actually is
           Thus the future mining difficulty is lowered by the algorithm

    Reasoning:
        1. To achieve 
            step 1: 
                    Solve the mining problem, edit the algorithm to make sure the block timestamp field to be intentionally
                    marginally higher yet accepted.

            step 2: GetNextWorkRequired() is used to adjust the mining difficulty based on previous mining difficulty.
                    The algorithm logic is that it systematically checks if the blocks are over-produced or under-produced.
                    If the block is over / under-produced than exepcted by a factor of 4, i.e. a quarter or four times than exepcted,
                    the number of hash bits (an indicator of difficulty) is adjusted by the ratio in proportion to the expected 
                    produced blocks and actual produced blocks. If the margin is not too large, then simply adjust by the ratio.
                    Otherwise if margin is greater than 4, then adjust 4 at maximum. Thus the difficulty is possible to be lowered
                    to be 25% as previous. If this process continues, the difficulty could be continously lowered to be 25 percent:
                    new_difficulty = diff * 0.25^n. This way, it's possible that mining difficulty could be as low.
    
    Problem:
            Once the mining difficulty is lowered, the hash is solved more quickly. It will tend to over-produce the blocks.
            Therefore, unless the majority miners collude to agree to publish their time stamp marginally higher. The
            mining difficulty will be soon adjusted to be more difficult.
